"It's just some miscellaneous programs" -- me
Hey, guys.
I'm a young programmer learning my way through the JAVA world.
I guess...?
This package (Project)) consists of a few miscellaneous programs.
I think you can install these once I upload this shit to github.
I started this on the 15th of June, 2023, during this scorching heat.
