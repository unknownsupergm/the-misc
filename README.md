"It's just some miscellaneous programs" -- me <BR>
Hey, guys. <BR>
I'm a young programmer learning my way through the JAVA world. <BR>
I guess...? <BR>
This package (Project)) consists of a few miscellaneous programs. <BR>
I think you can install these once I upload this shit to github. <BR>
I started this on the 15th of June, 2023, during this scorching heat. <BR>
